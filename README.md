# Blackjack

### Live site: _coming soon_

This is a single-page, browser-based version of Blackjack (aka "21"). Features ability to bet, double down, and split up to two hands. Built with Svelte and TypeScript.

This repo contains a fresh take on a web development project that I've built and revisited several times over the years. The repo for earlier editions of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/johnnycopes/blackjack-old).

#### Goals of this project:

- Learn the Svelte framework by building a project with it
- Configure Jest in the project to enable test coverage of all functionality
- Make a sleek-looking game with professional assets, smooth animations, and full mobile device responsiveness

#### Local installation:

To run this locally on your machine, clone the repo and enter the following commands into your CLI:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
