### Live site: [https://blackjack-wip.surge.sh](https://blackjack-wip.surge.sh)

This is a single-page, browser-based version of Blackjack (aka "21"). Features ability to bet and play basic games (advanced functionality like double down, split, and insurance are in development!) Built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

This repo contains a fresh take on a web development project that I've built and revisited several times over the years. The repo for earlier editions of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/johnnycopes/blackjack-old).

#### Goals of this project:

- Learn the Svelte framework by building a project with it
- Set up Jest in the project to in order to write unit and integration tests
- Make a sleek-looking game with professional assets, smooth animations, and full mobile device responsiveness

#### Local installation:
